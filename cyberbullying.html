        <h2>w hat Is Cyberbullying</h2>
        <p> Cyberbullying is bullying that takes place over digital devices like cell phones, computers, and tablets.
            Cyberbullying can occur through SMS, Text, and apps, or online in social media, forums, or gaming where
            people can view, participate in, or share content. Cyberbullying includes sending, posting, or sharing
            negative, harmful, false, or mean content about someone else. It can include sharing personal or private
            information about someone else causing embarrassment or humiliation. Some cyberbullying crosses the line
            into unlawful or criminal behavior <br><br><br>

            The most common places where cyberbullying occurs are: <br>

            Social Media, such as Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, and Tik Tok <br>
            Text messaging and messaging apps on mobile or tablet devices <br>
            Instant messaging, direct messaging, and online chatting over the internet <br>
            Online forums, chat rooms, and message boards, such as Reddit <br>
            Email <br>
            Online gaming communities <br>
            Special Concerns <br><br><br>
            With the prevalence of social media and digital forums, comments, photos, posts, and content shared by
            individuals can often be viewed by strangers as well as acquaintances. The content an individual shares
            online – both their personal content as well as any negative, mean, or hurtful content – creates a kind of
            permanent public record of their views, activities, and behavior. This public record can be thought of as an
            online reputation, which may be accessible to schools, employers, colleges, clubs, and others who may be
            researching an individual now or in the future. Cyberbullying can harm the online reputations of everyone
            involved – not just the person being bullied, but those doing the bullying or participating in it. <br><br>
            Cyberbullying has unique concerns in that it can be: <br>

            Persistent – Digital devices offer an ability to immediately and continuously communicate 24 hours a day, so
            it can be difficult for children experiencing cyberbullying to find relief. <br>

            Permanent – Most information communicated electronically is permanent and public, if not reported and
            removed. A negative online reputation, including for those who bully, can impact college admissions,
            employment, and other areas of life. <br>

            Hard to Notice – Because teachers and parents may not overhear or see cyberbullying taking place, it is
            harder to recognize. <br><br>

            Laws and Sanctions <br>
            All states have laws requiring schools to respond to bullying. As cyberbullying has become more prevalent
            with the use of technology, many states now include cyberbullying, or mention cyberbullying offenses, under
            these laws. Schools may take action either as required by law, or with local or school policies that allow
            them to discipline or take other action. Some states also have provisions to address bullying if it affects
            school performance. You can learn about the laws and policies in each state, including if they cover
            cyberbullying. <br>
