        <h2>What Is Bullying</h2>
        <p> Bullying is unwanted, aggressive behavior among school aged children that involves a real or perceived
            power imbalance. The behavior is repeated, or has the potential to be repeated, over time. Both kids who
            are bullied and who bully others may have serious, lasting problems. <br>

            In order to be considered bullying, the behavior must be aggressive and include: <br>

            An Imbalance of Power: Kids who bully use their power—such as physical strength, access to embarrassing
            information, or popularity—to control or harm others. Power imbalances can change over time and in
            different situations, even if they involve the same people. <br>
            Repetition: Bullying behaviors happen more than once or have the potential to happen more than once.
            Bullying includes actions such as making threats, spreading rumors, attacking someone physically or
            verbally, and excluding someone from a group on purpose. <br>

            Taunting <br>
            Threatening to cause harm <br>
            Social bullying, sometimes referred to as relational bullying, involves hurting someone’s reputation or
            relationships. Social bullying includes: <br><br>
            Leaving someone out on purpose <br>
            Telling other children not to be friends with someone <br>
            Spreading rumors about someone <br>
            Embarrassing someone in public <br>

            Making mean or rude hand gestures <br>
            Where and When Bullying Happens <br>
            Bullying can occur during or after school hours. While most reported bullying happens in the school
            building, a significant percentage also happens in places like on the playground or the bus. It can also
            happen travelling to or from school, in the youth’s neighborhood, or on the Internet. <br>
