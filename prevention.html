        <p>Parents, school staff, and other caring adults have a role to play in preventing bullying. They can: <br>

            <br> Help kids understand bullying. Talk about what bullying is and how to stand up to it safely. Tell kids
            bullying is unacceptable. Make sure kids know how to get help.
            Keep the lines of communication open. Check in with kids often. Listen to them. Know their friends, ask
            about school, and understand their concerns.
            Encourage kids to do what they love. Special activities, interests, and hobbies can boost confidence, help
            kids make friends, and protect them from bullying behavior.
            Model how to treat others with kindness and respect. <br>


            <br> Help Kids Understand Bullying <br>

            Kids who know what bullying is can better identify it. They can talk
            about bullying if it happens
            to them or others. Kids need to know ways to safely stand up to bullying and how to get help.

            Encourage kids to speak to a trusted adult if they are bullied or see others being bullied. The adult can
            give comfort, support, and advice, even if they can’t solve the problem directly. Encourage the child to
            report bullying if it happens.
            Talk about how to stand up to kids who bully. Give tips, like using humor and saying “stop” directly and
            confidently. Talk about what to do if those actions don’t work, like walking away
            Talk about strategies for staying safe, such as staying near adults or groups of other kids.
            Urge them to help kids who are bullied by showing kindness or getting help.
